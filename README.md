# CellularAutomata
This is from a long dead project of mine from over a year ago, but I still enjoy having it around for reference!
What this program does is generates a grid of randomly generated numbers, then runs several operations to generate clusters of those generated numbers. This is veru useful for map generation, and this particular script is designed to be used within Unity
